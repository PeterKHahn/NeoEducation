NeoEducation was founded on the principle that students should have control over the information that
they learn.

Structure of the Server
----------
There are two components of the server, a React App in the front end that is routable, as well as a
backend server that has an api that handles the database logic. The backend uses ktor and serves as
an API that can be queried given the correct credentials from Google OAuthentication

Studying Strategy
------
- Prioritize: Being able to rank which cards are the most important to study,
taking into account how comfortable you are with the card as well as how relevant
it is to your studies.
- Categorize: Understanding that many ideas can be grouped together, and therefore
should be studied together. Concepts falling within the same topic or subtopic can
be categorized as such.
- Generalize: Memorizing specifics is not as valuable as understanding big concepts.
Categorization allows us to group ideas together, generalization allows us to
understand and study those topics at a high level, especially after categorizing and
prioritizing the information you need to study.
